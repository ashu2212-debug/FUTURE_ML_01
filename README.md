# FUTURE_ML_01
This repository includes a ML project named " Sales and demand forecasting for business" . 


# 📈 Sales Forecasting Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on forecasting future sales using historical sales data.  
The goal is to analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns in sales and build predictive models that help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Linear Regression
- SARIMA & ARIMA
- Time and series

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Historical sales data with features such as date, store, product, and sales quantity.
- Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- ARIMA
- SARIMA
- Time and Series


  ## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   📌 Results

The models successfully capture sales trends and seasonality.

Tree-based and deep learning models perform better for complex patterns.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add SARIMA/Prophet models

Hyperparameter tuning

Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit

Real-time sales prediction dashboard
